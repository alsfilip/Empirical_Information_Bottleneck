# Auditory 2AFC task

In this task subject predicted which of two sources would generate a tone on the next trial. 

Tones were generated in the left or the right ear. When source 0 generated tones, subejcts heard tones primarily in the left ear (80% of the time), but also sometimes tones in the right ear (20% of the time - probabilities reversed when generated by source 2).

The sources sometimes switched with a probability govern by a hazard rate which could either be very low (.01), intermediate (.3) or very high (.99). Subjects were informed about the tone probabilities, and about the switch probabilities, but were not told which source was generating tones on each trial, nor what hazard rate applied on any trial.

In the main folder, the "Empirical_Information_Bottleneck_Test.ipynb" notebook provides a case study of a model used in this environment.

The raw response data is found in the 'A2AFC_bdat.csv' file and contains the collowing columns:

Subject: unique subject identifier
Stim: Tone the subject heard on that trial (1 for left, 2 for right)
Source: the source generating the tone (0 for mostly left, 1 for mostly right)
Hazard: hazard rate on that particular trial
TSCP: Trial since the last change point (1 being the trial on which the switch occured)
Resp: Subject prediction of the source that would generate the tone on that trial (note - occurs before the tone occurs)
Correct: Whether or not the subject's prediction was correct
Session: Session identifier - subject participated in up to three sessions, each on separate days (note that not all subjects participated in all sessions)
